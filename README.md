## Projects:

### 1.Finding Donors for CharityML:
Apply supervised learning techniques on data collected for the US census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their cause.
 
### 2. Create Your Own Image Classifier: 
Define and train a neural network in TensorFlow that learns to classify images; going from image data exploration to network training and evaluation.
